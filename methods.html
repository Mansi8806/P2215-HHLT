    <h1>Methodology.</h1>
    <p>For Remote Sensing data, we have created a Postgres database and along with is a metadata table which is having details of the collected imageries in the database like, 
	Satellite name, date, source and whether the image is orthorectified or not. We have documented a general Habitat suitability analysis workflow of one of the property named Barnum Creeek Nature Reserve owned by Haliburton county.
    At the end we have created some good quality and appealing maps from the results to show outputs of Spatial Analysis workflows. 
	   Apart from this there is guide made to refer how different remote sensing softwares can used for different analysis. In addition, we have integrated the Feature Manipulation Engine workflows for ETL (Extract Transfer Load) process

    <h2>Northern Bog Aster Habitat Suitability Analysis.</h2>
    <p> The study area selected for this analysis was an area that surrounded and 
	included Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park which is partly within Haliburton County.
	3 criterias were selected to perform the analysis; wetland areas, aspect or direction of the ground surface
	and the urban development in the area which is divided into sections, one is urban landuse 
	(this includes industrial, residential, cemetery, retail, and quarry areas) and other is Roads infrastructure. 
	Wetlands being the most dominant for this plant's growth was given the weightage of 40% and other two were given 30% each. 
	Therefore, 15% each divided amoungst two categories of urban development.</p>
	
	<p>Each suitability surface for each criteria were obtained using the various geoprocessing tools of ArcGIS Pro like merge, buffer, dissolve, euclidean distance and reclassify. 
	The workflow for one such urban lanuse criteria in model builder is shown in figure below. 
	Then Weighted Overlay tool was used at last to specify weightage to all criterias and 
	finally obtain the habitat suitability surface.</p>

        <p>Suitability definition for suitability ratings from 1 to 7 where 7 is assigned the most suitable value and 1 being the 
	least suitable for plant growth is shown in figure below.</p>

        <h1>Visualization</h1>
       <p>To create a map poster of size 34x44 inches in landscape orientation, layout was prepared to position the map elements. 
	  Then facts and basic information was found out for Rush aster plant. A local scene map in ArcGIS Pro was created to show all 4 criteriaâ€™s suitability surfaces in 3D view giving 10x vertical exaggeration as 
	  there is not much of the difference in elevation in the study area.To create an interactive element, icon drawings of all 4 criteria were done in Adobe Illustrator as shown in figure here.
	  Lastly, charts and threaded table was created to show analysis results and summarize the information.</p>
